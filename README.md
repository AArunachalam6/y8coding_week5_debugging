# Y8 Coding Week 4: Debugging

## Intro

Your task is to go through each of the files and work out what is causing the problem (the bug).

Fix the code, and run it to make sure it now works as expected.

Finally, add a ## comment to the bottom of the file explaining what the problem was, then move onto the next file.
