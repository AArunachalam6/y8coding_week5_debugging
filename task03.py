### What was wrong ?
### DISCUSS HERE:
### the first thing that was wrong is that the computer doesn't know what 'name' is so you have to make a variable for 'name' which they didn't do. The other thing is that line 2 needs to be indented since it is following an 'if' statement.
### Was this a... syntax, logical or runtime error?
